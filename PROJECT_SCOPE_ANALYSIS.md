## üöÄ **TECHNICAL DEBT & OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **Current Issues to Address:**

1. **API Consistency**: Some endpoints use old patterns, need standardization
2. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error boundaries
3. **Testing**: No automated tests currently implemented
4. **Performance**: Large file upload optimization needed
5. **Security**: Additional audit logging required for compliance

### **Recommended Improvements:**

1. Add comprehensive form validation
2. Implement real-time notifications
3. Add audit logging for all document actions
4. Create automated backup systems
5. Implement advanced search and filtering

**üéØ CONCLUSION: We have a solid foundation (45% complete) with excellent infrastructure, but need to build the compliance-specific features that make this a true compliance DMS rather than a generic document management system.**
